# include/

Purpose
- Public headers for the C parser and related components.

Files
- grammar.h: Parser interface header generated from Bison; copied into this folder during build.
- lexrules.h: Lexer rule declarations used across lex sources.
- lojban.h: Common project-wide definitions.
- node.h: AST/node structure declarations.
- token.h: Token kinds and lexer interfaces.
- version.h: Version and build metadata (updated by generation pipeline).

Subdirectories
- generated/: Generated include fragments:
  - rulename.i: Rule-name tables (generated by `tools/mknames`).
  - selmao.i: Selma'o tables used by `selmao.c`/`mkcmavo.c`.

Notes
- Headers under `include/` are consumed by sources in `src/` and by users integrating the parser.
